/**
 * Class for computing the quality of a Pareto front in two-dimensional spaces using the
 * hyper-volume indicator. It measures the size of the space enclosed by all solutions on the Pareto
 * front and a user-defined reference point. The hyper-volume accounts for both proximity and
 * diversity and is strictly Pareto compliant. This means that whenever a given Pareto front
 * dominates another front the hyper-volume of the former front is strictly greater than the volume
 * of the latter. On significant drawback to this measure is that its magnitude is dependent upon an
 * arbitrarily chosen reference point.
